v1.0.0 2015/11/29

- User changes:
    - Fixed an issue which caused t_list to fail when filtering by keywords on large lists
    - Removed the project keywords feature. It was not very useful and made the searching code more complicated
    - Fixed ical support: it now works with ical 3.6 or later
    - Improved documentation
    - Added Keywords field to yokadi.desktop
- Developer changes:
    - Yokadi has been ported to Python 3
    - The application now uses SQLAlchemy instead of SQLObject to access the SQLite database

v0.14 2014/05/03
- Command changes:
    - t_add, n_add:
        - Allow creating two tasks with the same title (useful for recurrent tasks, like "buy bread").
        - Allow using _ to select last project, making it possible to do multiple t_add on the same project with `t_add _ <task description>`.
        - Add --describe option to start describing the task right after adding it.
    - t_describe, n_describe:
        - Safer task description editing: task is updated each time the editor saves, a lock manager now prevents multiple edits.
        - Use .md suffix instead of .txt for the temporary filename to allow some smart things with editors that understand Markdown.
        - Use project and task name for the temporary filename. Useful when using graphical editors or when your terminal title shows the current running command.
    - t_due:
        - When called with a time argument which is before current time, set due date to the day after.
    - t_show:
        - Show the task ID.
    - t_list:
        - Use month and year for the task age if the task is older than 12 months.
        - Add support for arbitrary minimum date for --done.
        - Fixed broken help.
    - n_list:
        - Display creation date instead of age.
        - Notes are now grouped by date.
    - p_list:
        - Show task count per project.
    - p_remove:
        - Show the number of associated tasks in the prompt.
    - p_edit:
        - Handle case where user tries to rename a project using the name of an existing project.

- yokadid:
    - Add --restart option and --log option.
    - Set process name with setproctitle.
    - Configuration keys can now be overridden using environment variables.

- Misc:
    - Date/time commands now support %d/%m/%y date format.
    - Replaced xyokadi with a desktop file.
    - Updated README to match real output.

- Developer specific changes:
    - Command parser has been ported from optparse to argparse.
    - Code is now PEP 8 compliant, with the exception of camelCase usage.
    - All imports have been changed to absolute imports (ie `import yokadi.<something>`).
    - Code has been reorganized into different sub directories.
    - The scripts in bin/ are now smart enough to run the source tree version instead of the installed version if possible.
    - We now use Travis for continuous integration.
