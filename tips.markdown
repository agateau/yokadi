# Intro

This document presents practical advices on how to get the best out of Yokadi.

# Completion

Yokadi supports completion of command names, and in quite a few commands it can
complete project names. Do not hesitate to try the `[tab]` key!

# Setting up a project hierarchy

You can set up a project hierarchy by adopting a name convention. For example if
you want to track tasks related to a program which is made of many plugins, you
could have the main project named `fooplayer`, all tasks for the .ogg plugin
stored in `fooplayer_ogg` and all tasks about the .s3m plugin in
`fooplayer_s3m`.

This makes it easy to categorize your tasks and also to have a general overview.
For example to list all `fooplayer` related tasks you can use:

    t_list fooplayer%

# Using keywords

Keywords are great to group tasks in different way. For example you can create a
keyword named `phone`, and assign it to tasks which you must accomplish on the
phone.

Another useful keyword is `diy_store`: Everytime you find that you need to buy
some supply from a do-it-yourself store, add it with this keyword. Next time you
are planning a trip to the store, get the list of what to buy with:

    t_list -k diy_store

Or even nicer, directly print your list (from the shell):

    yokadi t_list -k diy_store --format plain | lp

# Keep track of your meetings

To track my meetings, I like to use a `meeting` keyword together with an
assigned due date. Yokadi ability to add long descriptions to tasks is also
handy to associate address or contact information to a meeting task.
